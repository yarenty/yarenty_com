Inspired by a tweet from Andrej Karpathy, this post explores "system prompt learning." The author conducted an experiment teaching an AI to code by giving it the persona of a music composer. The post details how the AI's prompt evolved, leading to significant improvements in error handling, documentation, and code structure, suggesting that creative and reflective prompts can be a powerful way to teach AI.
