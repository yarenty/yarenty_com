## About Me

I am a software architect with a passion for high-performance computing, currently focusing on machine learning and deep learning on FPGAs and ASICs. My language of choice is Rust, but I'm also proficient in Scala, Swift, Java, and C++.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy web and iOS development, exploring the world of IoT, and mountain walking.

This website is a collection of my projects, thoughts, and interests.
